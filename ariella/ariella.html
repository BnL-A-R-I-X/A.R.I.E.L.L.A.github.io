        <h3>Operational History</h3>
        <p>
            A.R.I.E.L.L.A. is the inaugural production prototype in the Ariella‑Class Enforcement Platform line — 
            an advanced humanoid tactical unit designed to combine rapid‑response capabilities with a high‑degree 
            of social interaction proficiency. Deployed aboard the Buy n Large flagship <em>AXIOM</em> for live‑environment 
            field trials, her operational evaluation is focused on three core areas: compliance efficiency, incident 
            resolution speed, and integration stability with existing ShipNet security protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the course of her deployment, A.R.I.E.L.L.A. has demonstrated exemplary performance in crowd control, 
            threat assessment, and diplomatic mediation between passengers and crew. While optimized for strict adherence 
            to BnL Security Protocol 7729‑X, she has exhibited a consistent tendency to prioritize the safety and emotional 
            well‑being of crew members — even when such actions require bypassing non‑critical corporate directives.
        </p>
        <p>
            In multiple high‑risk situations, she has successfully de‑escalated volatile encounters without resorting to 
            lethal force, earning commendations from both the BnL Security Robotics Division and the Axiom's senior staff. 
            Data gathered from these events has been flagged as critical input for the refinement of future Ariella‑Class 
            models. Despite her prototype status, she has attained near‑perfect mission‑completion metrics and is 
            regarded by on‑board personnel as a dependable — if occasionally unorthodox — member of the ship's security framework.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Behavioral Profile -->
    <section class="bnl-section">
        <h3>Behavioral Profile</h3>
        <p>
            Built to serve as a bridge between machine precision and approachable authority, 
            A.R.I.E.L.L.A. possesses an advanced Adaptive Interaction Matrix, allowing her to adjust tone, 
            body language, and conversational approach depending on the subject. This has resulted in 
            unusually strong rapport with both crew and passengers, particularly among individuals who 
            exhibit distrust toward traditional robotic enforcers.
        </p>
        <p>
            She often integrates subtle humor, empathy cues, and carefully‑timed gestures in dialogue — 
            behavioral traits not explicitly programmed into her baseline firmware. Internal telemetry 
            suggests these behaviors developed organically as a byproduct of prolonged interaction 
            with organic crew members. While classified as “non‑critical anomalies” by BnL engineering, 
            they remain under observation for potential benefits in long‑term mission sustainability.
        </p>

    <!-- Asset Significance -->
    <section class="bnl-section">
        <h3>Asset Significance</h3>
        <p>
            The Ariella‑Class project represents a new philosophy in BnL security robotics — one that blends 
            high‑efficiency enforcement systems with human‑level social nuance. If successful, 
            it will redefine corporate security presence aboard all BnL deep‑space liners and 
            high‑value installations. As the flagship prototype, A.R.I.E.L.L.A.’s successes and failures 
            will directly inform the production blueprint for an entire generation of enforcement units.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, her continued field evaluation aboard the <em>AXIOM</em> remains a top‑priority 
            directive for the BnL Security Robotics Division. All collected data is routed in real‑time to 
            BnL Research & Development Command for analysis and integration into Version 2.0 specifications.

    <!-- Adaptive Form Morphology -->
    <section class="bnl-section">
        <h3>Adaptive Form Morphology</h3>
        <p>
            As part of her prototype evaluation, A.R.I.E.L.L.A. has been fitted with the 
            <strong>BNL Morph‑Shift Composite Armor Framework</strong>, a next‑generation exo‑plating 
            system that allows her physical structure to reconfigure between two primary operational forms: 
            <em>Humanoid Enforcement Configuration</em> and <em>Anthropomorphic Combat Configuration</em>.
        </p>

        <h4>&#129302; Humanoid Enforcement Configuration</h4>
        <p>
            In this mode, her armor panels settle into a sleek, humanoid silhouette designed for 
            <strong>diplomatic presence, crowd management, and public‑facing patrols</strong>. 
            The exo‑plating is smoothed and streamlined, with joint actuators recessed for minimal 
            visual bulk. Facial plates align into a more humanlike profile, visor opacity adjusts 
            for greater approachability, and armor coloration shifts subtly toward softer pearl‑white 
            tones. Weapon mounts remain concealed beneath retractable plates, maintaining a 
            non‑threatening appearance while preserving full tactical readiness.
        </p>

        <h4>&#128021; Anthropomorphic Combat Configuration</h4>
        <p>
            Triggered by high‑threat alerts or explicit command directives, this mode deploys her 
            <strong>Enhanced Mobility Combat Frame</strong>. Armor panels split and shift along 
            micro‑rail joints, revealing reinforced joint servos, extended digitigrade limb assemblies, 
            and <em>deer‑themed</em> tactical extremities such as cloven hoof stabilizers and an extended 
            kinetic‑balance tail. The helmet assembly lengthens into a streamlined cervine facial crest 
            with expanded sensory horns and forward‑tilted visor optics for optimal battlefield scanning.  
            Exposed high‑flex polymer segments at the limbs and back increase articulation and spring force, 
            enabling rapid directional changes and greater jump capacity in low‑gravity environments.
        </p>

        <h4>Armor Shift Process</h4>
        <p>
            Transition between forms is achieved through synchronized servo actuation, micro‑hydraulic 
            expansion chambers, and shape‑memory alloy linkages integrated into each armor plate.  
            On receiving a mode‑shift command, armor segments disengage magnetic anchor points, slide 
            along internal guide rails, and lock into their alternate positions within approximately 
            <strong>2.8 seconds</strong>. The system is designed to function even under combat conditions, 
            allowing her to adapt mid‑engagement as operational needs change.
